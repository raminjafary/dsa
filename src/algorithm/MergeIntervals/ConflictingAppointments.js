// Given an array of intervals representing â€˜Nâ€™ appointments, find out if a person can attend all the appointments.

// Example 1:
// Appointments: [[1,4], [2,5], [7,9]]
// Output: false
// Explanation: Since [1,4] and [2,5] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.

// Example 2:
// Appointments: [[6,7], [2,4], [8,12]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: None of the appointments overlap, therefore a person can attend all of them.

// Example 3:
// Appointments: [[4,5], [2,3], [3,6]]
// Output: false
// Explanation: Since [4,5] and [3,6] overlap, a person cannot attend both of these appointments.
